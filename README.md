# ESX Roleplay Missions
This resource adds a menu to show missions you created in the config. Currently 40 different mission triggers are available.
There is a UI available for mission information.

## Installation
In 'available triggers.txt' you can find all triggers you can use in your resource. If you want a client trigger, then remove the (source) from the corresponding update trigger. Only for server sided triggers you need to define what the source is. For support go to our Discord.
